      <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
      <p>My name is Samanyu Satheesh, and I'm an aspiring software engineer. Currently in my fourth year
        as a Computer Science major at Cal Poly Pomona, I'm passionate about software engineering and
        am looking to gain experience in the industry through an internship or full-time position.
      </p>
      <p>Born and raised in Mountain View, California, I grew up in a diverse community
        surrounded by some of the biggest names in tech. This exposure cultivated my interest in technology,
        with me pursuing fields such as robotics and coding in my younger years. I went on to take several Computer Science
        courses, with an interest in technology as a career. Following this path, I enrolled
        at Cal Poly Pomona, majoring in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>In my freshman year of college, I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma at the age of 18 and in 
        the middle of a deadly worldwide pandemic. Refusing to drop out of college, I continued classes online while 
        undergoing chemotherapy and surgical operations at home. I've since beat it, 
        and thanks to my perseverance, am still graduating in only 4 years. Having witnessed firsthand the marginalization
        faced by those with chronic health issues, I am ambitious to prove that it is possible to face extreme 
        adversity and still achieve your dreams.
      </p>
      <p>In my free time, I love to play the drums, try new foods, and listen to music. I enjoy spending time with friends
        and family, as well as learning new things. I'm currently learning more about robotics, and how we can use artificial intelligence
        alongside robotics to solve complex problems.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>UAV Fire Detection</h3>
      <img src="uavpic.PNG" alt="Project 1" style="width: 400px;">
      <p>In the Fall 2023 Semester, I joined the UAV Fire Detection Project sponsored by Lockheed Martin at Cal Poly Pomona.
        As the Machine Learning Team Lead, I was tasked with coordinating the ML team members and finding ways for us to collaborate and
        achieve our goal: our autonomous UAV being able to identify wildfires using machine learning. Using the YOLOv8 software,
        we were able to train a model to recognize fires with an accuracy rate of about 80%. Through this process, I practiced
        and built upon my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, providing updates to the Project Lead in a timely manner.
        Additionally, I helped present our team's progress and implementation plans to Lockheed Martin represenatives.

      <h3>Boston Dynamics SPOT Project</h3>
      <img src="IMG_3296.jpg" alt="Project 2" style="width: 300px;">  
      <p>In Spring 2023, I joined the CPP Boston Dynamics SPOT Project, where we programmed SPOT to autonomously deliver packages. 
        Using fiducial markers (sort of like QR codes), SPOT could locate and move towards a package, pick it up using
        its arm, and deliver it to another marked location. We coded in Python and used the Boston Dynamics SDK to help bridge the gap between
        the software and hardware components of this robotics project. We presented our project at the College of Science Research Symposium
        as well as at an Open House for new students.

      <h3>Flashcard Mobile App</h3>
      <img src="app_gif.gif" 
      alt="Project 3" style="height: 300px;">
      <p>In this project, I designed and created an Android app for Flashcard decks using Java and Android Studio. 
        With my app, users can create, edit, and save their own flashcard sets. When quizzing themselves with the flashcards,
        they can either click on the card to flip it and reveal the result, or pick one of the three possible answers below. I imported
        libraries that allowed me to implement special effects, and added an icon for the app itself. I updated and added features to
        the app over the course of four weeks, and used an Android emulator on my machine to run testcases and debug.
